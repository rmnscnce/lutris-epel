## Description

Lutris is an open source gaming platform that makes gaming on Linux easier by managing, installing and providing optimal settings for games.

Lutris does not sell games. For commercial games, you must own a copy to install the game on Lutris. The platform uses programs referred to as 'runners' to launch games, Those runners (with the exception of Steam and web browsers) are provided and managed by Lutris, so you don't need to install them with your package manager.

Scripts written by the community allow access to a library of games. Using scripts, games can be played without manual setup.

## Installation instructions
~~~
dnf copr enable rmnscnce/lutris-epel
